# Samplelists
This directory in the displacedLegacy branch needs a huge clean-up, for sure it does not make sense to have so many different sample lists being around.

To-do list:
* Delete all old/outdated sampleLists
* Make sure that new sampleLists have an easy and understandable name
* If there is really a need for different kind of sampleLists (other than an updating version number like vXX) then document it really well in the file itself
* Make sure that all 2016 samples are miniAODv3 (miniAODv2 is not supported anymore by this branch)
